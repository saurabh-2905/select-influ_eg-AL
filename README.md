# Selecting Influential Examples for Active Learning

In this work, we talk about selecting the most important samples to be selected for active learning. This makes use of semi-seupervised approach to select the imfluential samples.
To decide the importance or uniqueness of the samples, weight is assigned to each sample. Three different methods are proposed to assign the weights depending on the uniqueness of the sampels. 

In this project, Tensorflow2.0 is used as a deep learning framework. It also makes use of the machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbours, K-Means clustering and Soft-voting.
