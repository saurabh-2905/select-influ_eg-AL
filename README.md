# select-influ_eg-AL

In this work, we talk about selecting the most important samples to be selected for active learning. This makes use of semi-seupervised approach to select the imfluential samples.
To decide the importance or uniqueness of the samples, weight is assigned to each sample. Three different methods are used to assign the weights. 

In this project, Tensoerflow 2.0 is used as a deep learnign framework. It also makes use of the machine learning algorithms like KNN, K-means and Soft-voting.
